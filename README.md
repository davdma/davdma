### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year student at the University of Chicago majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently working part-time with the environmental science team at Argonne National Laboratory to develop high resolution real-time flood prediction models! 

I love to:
- Sail on Lake Washington
- Cook for friends
- Meditate and relax

Below you will find the code for my previous projects involving ML:
* I worked on `TransferLearningArgonne` over the summer of 2022 building models to predict how bioaccumulative a substance is given its chemical structure, and an exploratory attempt to target the problematic PFAS.
* `FloodSamplesArgonne` contains code for the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data pipeline and water segmentation model that I have been recently working on at Argonne this year.
