### Hi there 👋

I'm a recent graduate at the University of Chicago with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently working full time with the environmental science team at Argonne National Laboratory to develop custom datasets and high resolution real-time flood mapping models for their Illinois region emergency management initiative.

Below you will find the code for my previous projects involving ML and data pipelines:
* `floodmaps` is my largest project, containing code for the Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery data pipeline and water pixel detection model that I have been working on at Argonne as a research data scientist. It also includes my work building an effective Conditional VAE model for despeckling (denoising) SAR images for prediction.
* `FredHutchKIs` is a cheminformatic deep learning project I worked on at the Gujral Lab at Fred Hutch over the summer of 2024, aiming to predict kinase inhibitor polypharmacology using transformer networks.
* I worked on `TransferLearningArgonne` over the summer of 2022 building models to predict how bioaccumulative a substance is given its chemical structure.
