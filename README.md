### Hi there 👋

I'm a third year student at the University of Chicago majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently working part-time with the environmental science team at Argonne National Laboratory to develop high resolution real-time flood prediction models! 

Below you will find the code for my previous projects involving ML.
